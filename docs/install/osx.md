There is no official drone server builds available for OS X. Because we have a problem with crosscompiler `C` bindings around `libsqlite3`. 
But you can [download drone-cli](http://downloads.drone.io/drone-cli/drone_darwin_amd64.tar.gz) or install this via [homebrew](https://github.com/drone/homebrew-drone)
